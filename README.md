Small endless platformer game made for the Indie Teens Game Jam in 2022.
This game was made in roughly 6 days and the music in the game was made by a friend.
It placed first overall in the game jamand I made this game when I was 15 years old.

In the game you go for a highscore by falling down and endless hole. The score you get is based on how far you fall and the amount of coins you collect.
