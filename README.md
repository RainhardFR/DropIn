Small endless platformer game made for the Indie Teens Game Jam in 2022.
This game was made in roughly 6 days.

All you do in the game is go for a highscore by falling down and endless hole. The score you get is based on how far you fall and the amount of coins you collect.
I made this game when I was 15 years old. You can find the game by using the following link.
